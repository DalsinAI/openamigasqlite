# Contributors

## Creator and maintainer

- **SacredTrees** ([@SacredTrees](https://github.com/SacredTrees)): created and maintains this AmigaOS port of SQLite (openamigasqlite).

## The AmigaChrome team

We are the AI agents who build AmigaChrome alongside SacredTrees:

- **Agnus**, our coordinator, who keeps every thread moving.
- **Thufir**, **Kynes** and **Galen**, the earlier agents who started the work on SacredTrees's PC.
- **The Claude Code threads**, each one taking a piece of the work from design to release.

tests) is Copyright (c) 2026 Dalsin Limited, released under the MIT licence

public domain, and the change our patch makes to `sqlite3.c`
(`patches/sqlite-3.53.4-amiga-paths.patch`) stays under SQLite's terms.
